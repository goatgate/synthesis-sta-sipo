- Arrival time: the amount of time a signal takes to arrive at end point in a particular timing path

- required time: the defined system specification/constraint for the time a signal takes on particular timing path i.e; we need to make sure that our arrival time is the same as our required time

- we set constraints for the minimum and maximum time that a signal has to take. Below we can look at an example constraint for min and max time and the slack calculation.

- The Min difference is called hold slack/hold timing while Max difference is called setup slack/setup timing

## Types of setup/hold timing

- Latch(time borrowing/time giving)

## Slew/transition Analysis
classification:
- Data slew
- Clock slew
